<!--* If something is a heading, you use a heading tag.
   * If something is a list, you use an unordered or ordered list tag.
   * So on and so forth.

7. The content for the `index.html` should be unique to **you**.

   * Write a paragraph or two about yourself. Make it fun, show your personality!
   * The main logo where it says "Your Name" should say your name. This may make the logo section smaller or wider depending on how long your name isâ€”that is fine and expected.
   * Add, commit, and push your code to GitHub often, especially when you complete a page.
